### What is Asynchronous Programming?
1. Not existing or occuring at the same time.
2. Controlling the timing of operations by the use of pulses sent when the previous operation is completed rather than at regular intervals.
Asynchronous means that you can execute multiple things at a time and you don't have to finish executing the current thing in order to move on to next one.

### Why does JavScript Act like Asynchronous?
Because JavaScript is a single threaded language. That means, JavaScript process one task at a time. JavaScript uses two Data structure to handle variables and function calls. 
1. Heap to manage Variables
2. Stack to manage Function calls
